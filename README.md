# DataCleaning
Tidy data is an important component of data cleaning, and while it may not be inherently as well known; tidy data is an important preprocessing step before conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). Hadley Whickam describes Tidy Data as "a standard way to organise data values within a dataset". 

In a nutshell, tidy data is about taking a dirty, messy dataset and converting it into a nuanced and more readable dataset. 

In this repository, I have added some examples of tidy data that I have worked on my free time to enhance and showcase my skills.
